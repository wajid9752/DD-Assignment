Create  
        a Django application demonstrating role-based authentication
        with distinct dashboards for Admin, Manager, and Employee roles,
        and a role-specific notification system. Use Django for backend 
        and a front-end framework of your choice.


Admin Dashboard: Display system stats like user count, 
      active projects. Filter by date or status.
Manager Dashboard: Show project data, team metrics. Filter by project, team, or timeline.
Employee Dashboard: List tasks, deadlines, personal metrics. Filter by priority or status.
Notifications:

Admins: System issues alerts.
Managers: Project milestones, team summaries.
Employees: Task deadlines, feedback.
Submit code via GitHub, with a README, 
setup instructions, and comments. 
Include unit tests for key functionalities. 
Assess functionality, code quality, security, and testing.
